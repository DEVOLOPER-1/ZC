## Introduction to Data Governance

* **Data Governance**: overall management of data within an organization through processes, policies, and controls
* **Objectives**:

  * Ensure data **accuracy**, **reliability**, and **security**
  * Define roles, responsibilities, and decision-making frameworks
* **Strategic Importance**:

  * Leverage data as a **strategic asset**
  * Enable **informed decision-making**
  * Achieve **regulatory compliance** and **risk mitigation**

## Rationale for Assessing Data Governance

* **Current-State Analysis**:

  * Understand existing data management maturity
  * Evaluate alignment with organizational objectives
* **Effectiveness Evaluation**:

  * Identify governance **gaps**, **weaknesses**, and **strengths**
  * Inform prioritization of improvement initiatives

## Benefits of Data Governance Assessment

* **Improvement Opportunities**

  * Strengthen data quality, accuracy, and reliability
* **Risk Mitigation**

  * Identify and address privacy, security, and compliance vulnerabilities
* **Enhanced Decision-Making**

  * Clarify data asset inventory for more reliable analytics
* **Regulatory Alignment**

  * Ensure adherence to data protection laws and industry standards

## Key Dimensions of Data Governance Maturity

* **Strategy & Vision**
* **Organization & Roles** (e.g., data stewards, data owners)
* **Policies & Standards**
* **Data Quality Management**
* **Metadata Management**
* **Data Privacy & Security**
* **Data Integration & Architecture**

## Maturity Models

### Capability Maturity Model Integration (`CMMI`)

* **Domains**: Process Management, Project Management, Engineering, Support, Supplier Management
* **Levels**:

  1. Initial
  2. Managed
  3. Defined
  4. Quantitatively Managed
  5. Optimizing

### Data Management Maturity (`DMM`)

* **Dimensions**: Governance, Architecture, Data, Organization, Sharing, Quality
* **Levels**:

  1. Nonexistent
  2. Awareness
  3. Repeatable
  4. Defined
  5. Managed
  6. Optimized

## Approaches to Assessing Maturity

* **Self-Assessment & Internal Audits**

  * Use predefined criteria: questionnaires, checklists
* **External Assessments & Benchmarking**

  * Engage consultants; compare against industry best practices
* **Interviews & Surveys**

  * Gather insights from key stakeholders and practitioners

## Maturity Levels Defined

1. **Initial/Ad Hoc**

   * No formal governance; decentralized practices; prevalent data quality issues
2. **Defined/Planned**

   * Strategy development phase; roles and basic policies identified; uneven implementation
3. **Repeatable**

   * Documented and consistent policies; integrated into business processes
4. **Managed**

   * Comprehensive framework; supporting tools; active monitoring via metrics; compliant security/privacy
5. **Optimized**

   * Continuous improvement culture; governance fully embedded in strategic planning; data-driven culture

## General Assessment Approach

1. **Select Maturity Model** (`CMMI` or `DMM`)
2. **Understand Levels**: familiarize with defined maturity stages
3. **Define Criteria**: map indicators to each maturity level
4. **Conduct Self-Assessment**: evaluate current practices
5. **Score & Analyze**: identify strengths, weaknesses, and gaps
6. **Identify Improvement Opportunities**: prioritize by impact and urgency
7. **Develop Action Plan**: outline steps, milestones, timelines, and responsibilities
8. **Monitor Progress**: continuously measure and adjust

## Metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* **Purpose**: quantify governance effectiveness, support monitoring and data-driven adjustments
* **Categories**:

  * **Data Quality Metrics**: accuracy, completeness, consistency, integrity
  * **Compliance & Risk Metrics**: privacy compliance, security incidents, risk exposure
  * **Data Access & Usage Metrics**: availability, utilization, access controls
  * **Governance Process Metrics**: policy adherence, issue resolution time, training participation

### Examples of Metrics & KPIs

* **Data Ownership**

  * % of assets with defined owners; timeliness of new-asset owner assignments
* **Data Stewardship**

  * Number of active stewards; timeliness of profiling, cleansing, and remediation tasks
* **Data Retention Compliance**

  * % of data retained per policy; non-compliance instances
* **Data Catalog Usage**

  * Unique users; search and view frequency
* **Awareness & Adoption**

  * % employees trained; volume of governance-related queries
* **Committee Effectiveness**

  * Meetings per quarter; % recommendations implemented
* **Asset Documentation**

  * % assets with up-to-date metadata and lineage; count of undocumented assets
* **Incident Response**

  * Average resolution time; escalations to senior management

## Roadmap for Improvement

1. **Understanding Current State**

   * Assess maturity; identify pain points and process gaps
2. **Defining Desired Future State**

   * Set data governance goals aligned with strategic and regulatory requirements
3. **Creating a Governance Roadmap**

   * Prioritize initiatives; define phases, action steps, and milestones
   * Allocate resources (budget, technology, personnel) and assign responsibilities

## Commonly Used Criteria in Maturity Models

1. **Governance Strategy**: documented strategy aligned with business goals
2. **Organization & Roles**: clearly defined roles; adequate resourcing
3. **Policies & Standards**: comprehensive documentation; organizational adherence
4. **Processes**: defined and integrated processes for quality, metadata, access, lifecycle
5. **Communication & Training**: stakeholder engagement plans; regular training
6. **Data Quality Management**: profiling, cleansing, monitoring, reporting
7. **Metadata Management**: tools and processes for consistent metadata capture
8. **Data Privacy & Security**: regulatory compliance; access controls and protections
9. **Performance Measurement**: metrics/KPIs with ongoing monitoring and reporting
10. **Continuous Improvement**: formal feedback loops; iterative framework enhancement
