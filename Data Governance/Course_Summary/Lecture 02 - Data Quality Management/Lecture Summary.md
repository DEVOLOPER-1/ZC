## Data Quality Management Overview

- **Data Quality**
    
    - Defined as the fitness of data for its intended use
        
    - Key dimensions: **Accuracy**, **Completeness**, **Consistency**, **Timeliness**, **Relevance**
        
- **Data Quality Management**
    
    - Ensures data meets desired quality standards
        
    - Prevents **incorrect insights**, **flawed decision-making**, and **operational inefficiencies**
        

## Data Quality Management Lifecycle

1. **Profiling and Assessment**
    
2. **Cleansing and Remediation**
    
3. **Validation and Verification**
    
4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
    

## Profiling and Assessment

### Data Profiling: Objectives

- Review source data structure, content, and interrelationships
    
- Highlight fields with quality issues and trace issue sources (e.g., user inputs, interface errors, data corruption)
    

### Data Profiling: Activities

- Collect descriptive statistics: `min`, `max`, `count`, `sum`
    
- Record data types, field lengths, and recurring patterns
    
- Tag data with keywords, descriptions, or categories
    
- Assess join risks: identify **key candidates**, **foreign-key candidates**, and dependencies
    
- Discover and validate metadata accuracy
    
- Perform inter-table analysis and distribution identification
    

### Data Profiling Levels

1. **Structure Discovery**
    
    - Validate formatting consistency (e.g., date formats: `YYYY-MM-DD` vs. `YYYY/DD/MM`)
        
    - Examine basic statistics: mean, median, standard deviation
        
2. **Content Discovery**
    
    - Detect nulls, empty fields, duplicates, incomplete values, outliers, anomalies
        
    - Validate against rules (e.g., transaction amount â‰¥ $0; consistent state codes)
        
3. **Relationship Discovery**
    
    - Identify relationships between tables or spreadsheet cells
        
    - Inform schema design, ETL flows, and join strategies
        

### Benefits of Data Profiling

- Improves data credibility and decision-making accuracy
    
- Eliminates duplications and anomalies before escalation
    
- Enables predictive analytics and proactive crisis management
    
- Facilitates traceability, encryption for security, and regulatory compliance
    

## Data Profiling Techniques

- **Summary Statistics**
    
    - Mean, median, mode, min, max, standard deviation
        
    - Reveal central tendency, spread, and variability
        
- **Data Distribution Analysis**
    
    - Histograms, box plots, frequency distributions
        
    - Identify patterns, skewness, and outliers
        
- **Data Completeness Checks**
    
    - Calculate percentage of missing values per variable
        
- **Data Uniqueness Checks**
    
    - Identify duplicate records
        
- **Data Pattern Analysis**
    
    - Assess formats, naming conventions, and structural regularities
        
- **Data Anomaly Detection**
    
    - Detect outliers and extreme values indicative of errors
        
- **Data Dependency Analysis**
    
    - Explore correlations, associations, and functional dependencies
        

## Data Cleaning and Remediation

### Definition

- Fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, improperly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data
    

### Cleaning vs. Transformation

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing data that does not belong in a dataset
    
- **Data Transformation** (`Data Wrangling`): Converting data from one format or structure into another
    

### Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Remove Duplicate or Irrelevant Observations**
    
    - De-duplication and removal of non-pertinent records
        
2. **Fix Structural Errors**
    
    - Standardize naming conventions and correct typos (e.g., unify `"N/A"` and `"Not Applicable"`)
        
3. **Filter Unwanted Outliers**
    
    - Exclude improper entries to improve dataset performance
        
4. **Handle Missing Data**
    
    - Drop observations, impute values, or adjust usage to navigate nulls
        
5. **Validate and QA**
    
    - Confirm that cleaning steps were successful
        

## Data Validation and Verification

### Definition

- Ensures data meets quality standards, business rules, and regulatory requirements
    
- Results in **accurate**, **reliable**, and **trustworthy** data
    

### Validation Steps

1. **Define Requirements**
    
    - Gather stakeholder needs; document data sources, elements, and criteria
        
2. **Data Profiling**
    
    - Leverage profiling outputs to refine validation scope
        
3. **Establish Quality Rules**
    
    - Specify rules for completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness, validity
        
    - Document in a data dictionary or metadata repository
        
4. **Implement Validation Checks**
    
    - Automate enforcement via tools or scripts (`pandas`, `NumPy`)
        
5. **Perform Validation**
    
    - Schedule checks during data ingestion and processing
        
    - Monitor KPIs; generate validation reports and alerts
        
6. **Handle Validation Failures**
    
    - Investigate discrepancies; apply corrective actions and enrichment
        
    - Document issues and resolutions
        
7. **Audit and Documentation**
    
    - Maintain audit trails of validation activities, scripts, and outcomes
        
8. **Continuous Improvement**
    
    - Refine validation processes with feedback, updated regulations, and new technologies
        

## Data Monitoring and Maintenance

### Purpose

- Continuous monitoring to identify and address data quality issues promptly
    
- Routine maintenance (updates, retirement) to sustain data quality
    

### Implementing Data Monitoring

1. **Define Objectives**: Anomaly detection, compliance checks, usage tracking
    
2. **Identify Critical Sources**: Focus on high-impact data
    
3. **Select Tools**: Real-time platforms (e.g., Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch, Splunk)
    
4. **Define Metrics & Thresholds**: Set KPIs and acceptable ranges
    
5. **Set Up Infrastructure**: Configure pipelines, alerts, and notifications
    
6. **Monitor Data Flows**: Track processes and detect bottlenecks or vulnerabilities
    
7. **Analyze & Respond**: Review alerts; automate or escalate remediation
    
8. **Iterate & Improve**: Update monitoring based on lessons learned and changing needs
    

## Implementing Data Quality Metrics

1. **Define Quality Dimensions**
    
    - Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency, Timeliness, Validity, Integrity, Relevance, Precision
        
2. **Specify Metrics per Dimension**
    
    - _Accuracy_: % of correctly recorded data
        
    - _Completeness_: % of missing values
        
    - _Consistency_: % of matching records across sources
        
    - _Timeliness_: Average update latency
        
    - _Validity_: % conforming to rules
        
    - _Integrity_: % maintaining referential constraints
        
3. **Implement Assessment Processes**

8. **Continuous Improvement**
    
    - Refine metrics and processes with evolving best practices
