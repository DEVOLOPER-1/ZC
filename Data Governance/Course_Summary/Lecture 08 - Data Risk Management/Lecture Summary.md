* **Data Quality Risks**

  * Corruption
  * Dark Data
* **Operational Risks**

  * Data Loss
  * Data Availability
  * Data Integration failures
* **Privacy Risks**

  * Non-compliance with regulations
  * Vendor Lock-in
* **Security Risks**

  * Data Breach
  * Unauthorized Data Persistence

## 3. Data Threat Taxonomy

* **Technical Threats**

  * Hacking, Cracking, Malware
  * Misuse, Human Errors
  * Data Leakage
  * Cloud & Mobile Vulnerabilities
  * Availability Attacks
* **Non-Technical Threats**

  * Physical & Environmental hazards
  * Insider Threats
  * Social Engineering & Dumpster Diving
  * Risks from Social Media

## 4. Common Risk Scenarios & Remedies

### Risk 1: Loss of Oversight

* **Issues**:

  * Diverse data sources → incompatible systems
  * Inconsistent datasets, data-quality issues, security lapses
* **Solution**:

  * Build a **data-driven culture**
  * Enforce **data best practices**

### Risk 2: Lack of Access to Fresh Business Data

* **Issues**:

  * Delayed trend spotting → reduced profit opportunity
  * Time lost chasing data access
* **Solution**:

  * Maintain a **live data catalog** for real-time metadata and source syncing

### Risk 3: Friction Between Teams

* **Issues**:

  * Emergence of data silos
  * Slow, manual access requests; incompatible formats
* **Solution**:

  * Enable **data self-service** via centralized catalogs

### Risk 4: Manual Processes Impacting Productivity

* **Issues**:

  * Slow, error-prone workflows
  * High cost of trivial mistakes
* **Solution**:

  * **Automate** repetitive tasks, validation, and error handling

### Risk 5: Lack of Data Literacy

* **Issues**:

  * Few staff understand best practices or detect quality issues
  * Human error causes \~85% of breaches
* **Solution**:

  * Train and equip non-technical users with **visual, low-code transformation tools**

## 5. Fundamentals of Data Risk Management

* **Definition**: Processes to **identify**, **assess**, and **mitigate** risks to data assets
* **Components**:

  * Risk analysis and reduction to acceptable levels
  * Employee training on breach prevention
* **Drivers**:

  * Remote work, evolving cyber threats, cloud security

## 6. Importance of Data Risk Management

* **Cost of Breach**: Average \$4.24 million per incident
* **Benefits**:

  * Comprehensive data inventory
  * Cost reduction (fines, wasted time)
  * Increased organizational agility
  * Proactive vs. reactive posture
  * Enhanced customer trust

## 7. Data Risk Management Framework

Risk Management Framework
│
├─ Risk Assessment
│   ├─ Identify vulnerabilities & threats
│   └─ Assess & prioritize risks
│
├─ Risk Mitigation
│   ├─ Preventive controls
│   ├─ Incident response & disaster recovery
│   └─ Backup & restoration
│
└─ Risk Monitoring & Review

```

### 7.1 Risk Assessment

* **Vulnerabilities**: System gaps exploitable by attackers
* **Threats**: Potential dangers compromising CIA triad
* **Assessment Tools**: `Nessus`, `OpenVAS`, `Metasploit`
* **Outcome**: Proactive risk mitigation; regulatory compliance

### 7.2 Risk Prioritization

* **Likelihood**: Historical data, expert judgment, threat intelligence
* **Impact**: Financial, operational, reputational, regulatory
* **Risk Scoring**: Assign ratings to focus resources

### 7.3 Risk Mitigation

#### Preventive Controls

* **Access Controls**: RBAC, MFA, ACLs
* **Encryption**: Data at rest & in transit
* **Data Loss Prevention**: DLP policies, monitoring
* **Network Segmentation**: Isolate sensitive zones
* **Patch Management**: Regular updates
* **Secure Configurations**: Harden OS, databases, firewalls
* **Security Awareness Training**

#### Incident Response & Disaster Recovery

* **Incident Response Plan (IRP)**: Identification, containment, eradication, recovery, lessons learned
* **Disaster Recovery**: Backup strategies (full, incremental, differential); off-site storage; restoration testing

### 7.4 Risk Monitoring & Review

* **Monitoring**: System health, access logs, SIEM for real-time alerts
* **Audits & Reviews**: Evaluate control effectiveness; access-control audits
* **Adaptation**: Update strategies to counter emerging threats

## 8. Integrating Risk Management into Data Governance

### 8.1 Data Classification & Categorization

* Levels: Public, Internal, Confidential, Highly Confidential
* Apply controls proportionate to sensitivity

### 8.2 Access Control & Authentication

* Enforce **least privilege** and **separation of duties**
* Leverage **MFA**, strong password policies, RBAC

### 8.3 Data Privacy & Compliance

* Comply with GDPR, CCPA, etc.
* Implement **privacy by design**, anonymization, consent management
* Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO)

### 8.4 Data Quality Management

* **Standards & Validation**: Profiling, cleansing, checks
* Ongoing monitoring via metrics, data stewardship

### 8.5 Incident Response & Handling

* Develop detailed playbooks: categorization, roles, detection, containment, communication, documentation

## 9. Best Practices

* **Employee Training**: Policies, phishing, password hygiene, remote-work security
* **Team Collaboration**: IT, security, governance alignment
* **Continuous Improvement**: Threat intelligence, training refresh, audit cycles
* **External Expertise**: Penetration tests, third-party assessments, compliance advisors

## 10. Challenges in Data Risk Management

* **Awareness & Understanding**: Securing stakeholder buy-in
* **Siloed Approaches**: Fragmented governance vs. risk management
* **Lack of Metrics**: Difficulty measuring effectiveness
* **Complex Data Ecosystems**: Diverse sources & formats
* **Evolving Regulations**: Staying compliant amidst change
* **Resource Constraints**: Budget and skilled personnel shortages
* **Balancing Risk & Innovation**: Protect data without stifling analytics
