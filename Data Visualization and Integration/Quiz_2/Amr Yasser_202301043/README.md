The analysis focuses on the following:

Identifying Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): These include global sales, regional sales, platform performance, genre performance, and sales growth.
Formulating Business Questions: Questions related to platform dominance, regional performance, and genre popularity.
Visualizing Trends: Using bar charts, stacked bar charts, and pie charts to visualize insights.

Visualizations
Chart 1: Top Platforms and Genres by Global Sales

A bar chart that compares the top 10 gaming platforms and 5 genres based on global sales. It allows users to identify the most popular platforms and genres in the market.
Chart 2: Regional Sales Trends by Year

A stacked bar chart showing regional sales trends over the years (North America, Europe, Japan, and Other regions). It provides insights into how sales have evolved regionally over time.
Chart 3: Global Sales Distribution by Genre

A pie chart displaying the distribution of global sales by genre. This visualization helps identify which genres dominate the market.
Data Cleaning
The dataset (vgsales.csv) is cleaned before analysis to ensure accurate results:

Missing values in columns like Year and Publisher are filled with placeholders (e.g., "Unknown").
Sales columns (e.g., NA_Sales, EU_Sales, etc.) are summed to get the total regional sales.
The data is filtered to focus on the most relevant platforms and genres.
Business Insights
Based on the analysis, the following insights are drawn:

Platform Strategy: The most popular platforms should be targeted for marketing campaigns. Companies should consider focusing their resources on these platforms to maximize sales.

Genre Strategy: Genres with the highest global sales should be prioritized for game development and marketing.

Regional Strategy: The app helps identify underperforming regions, where additional marketing efforts can drive sales. Understanding regional preferences (e.g., platform or genre popularity) is crucial for targeted marketing.

Sales Trends: The year-over-year trends in regional and global sales help understand the market's direction and forecast future game releases accordingly.
